# TfFd
This project implements a TensorFlow-based face detection model in Angular. It features real-time face detection, where the frame border dynamically turns red when more than one face is detected. This functionality serves as a foundation for various applications, such as online test proctoring, face enrollment systems, and other use cases requiring multi-face detection.

## Development server

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
